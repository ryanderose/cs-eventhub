Problem: I don't want to keep endlessly feeding Github CI errors back in as seperate tasks to coding agent.  I should not be “babysitting" ChatGPT 5 Codex or any coding agent, with practical setup notes and my probability-of-success take for each.

#1 — **Local “CI twin” the agent can run before pushing**  
**Idea:** Mirror your GitHub Actions steps locally so the agent can run the exact same checks in a dev container or runner image.  
**How to do it**

- **Single entrypoint**: create `taskfile.yml`/`Justfile` (or `make`) with targets that exactly match CI steps: `lint`, `typecheck`, `test`, `build`, `e2e`.
    
- **Runner parity**: use a **Dev Container** or Docker image that matches your CI runner (node, pnpm/yarn cache dirs, browsers, Playwright, etc.).
    
- **Emulate Actions**: wire up **nektos/act** to run your workflows locally; where `act` can’t fully match hosted runners, point your tasks to dockerized services (db, redis) via `docker-compose`.
    
- **Pre-push hook**: add a `pre-push` git hook (or `lefthook`/`pre-commit`) that calls the same task pipeline; your agent runs this hook as part of its “save” routine.
    
- **Fail-fast contract**: the agent only pushes if the full local pipeline is green.  
    **Pros:** fastest feedback loop, no GitHub round-trips, deterministic images.  
    **Cons:** `act` doesn’t cover 100% of Actions features; some hosted services/secrets differ.  
    **Probability of success:** **75%** (very robust if you keep runner images and commands truly identical).

## Concrete upgrades I recommend for a Turbo/Next.js monorepo

1. **Monorepo tasks that mirror CI**  
    Add a root Taskfile/Justfile (or Makefile) that maps to CI steps and to app-scoped steps (e.g., `apps/web`, `packages/*`). Make these the only commands your agent calls:
    

- `task setup-ci` → install/pins; `task check` → `turbo lint typecheck build`; `task test` → `turbo test`.  
    Wire a **pre-push hook** to run these.

2. **Turbo remote caching & explicit pipelines**  
    In GA, run `turbo run` with the same pipeline as local (build → test → e2e) and enable remote cache (Vercel/Turborepo or S3) so agents get fast feedback. (Pattern reinforced by the CI parity guidance.)

3. **Next.js-specific checks in CI**  
    Extend the “checks” job with Next-friendly gates:
    

- `next lint` (or `eslint`)
    
- `tsc -b` for all packages (noEmit)
    
- `next build` for affected apps
    
- (Optional) schema/codegen steps (Prisma, GraphQL) as part of `setup-ci`  
    Keep these behind the same single entrypoints so agents don’t need bespoke commands.

4. **Add Playwright e2e as a separate job with service containers**  
    If you have user-flows, split e2e into its own GA job with a `services:` block (DB, Redis) and let the agent run `task e2e` locally in Docker. This aligns with the matrix/guard patterns shown.

5. **Adopt the “knowledge repo” for agent artifacts**  
    Create `org/thoughts` (or reuse yours) and drop research/plan/ADR documents there; set up the deploy key and `.humanlayer.json` so agents can commit those docs without cluttering the monorepo.
    
    workflow-spec
    
6. **Introduce a reusable workflow (`workflow_call`)**  
    Extract your standard CI into `.github/workflows/ci-reusable.yml` and have all repos call it; mirror the template style from the specs. This reduces drift when you tweak toolchains or steps.
    
    workflow-spec
    
7. **GitHub App or “fork sandbox” later**  
    If you want hands-off retries: use the implement-plan patterns and add a gate that only promotes branches to the main repo when green—this fits neatly with the PR-linking and ticket updates already shown.

## Agent wiring patterns to adopt (minimal + safe)

- **ChatOps entrypoint** so humans can summon the agent in PRs/issues with guarded tools.
    
    workflow-spec
    
- **Queue-driven implement plan** to let the agent open branches/PRs and move tickets, but keep codeowners + branch protection for risk control.
    
    workflow-spec
    
- **Local pretesting discipline in prompts**: make the agent’s `/implement_plan` prompt always run `task setup-ci && task check && task test` before committing.

## Minimal next steps (copy/paste plan)

1. Add root **Taskfile/Justfile** targets: `setup-ci`, `check`, `test`, `e2e`, mapping to Turborepo + Next steps.
    
    pretesting-github-workflows
    
2. Add **pre-push hook** that runs `task check test`.

3. Create a private **knowledge repo** and wire the deploy key + `.humanlayer.json`.
    
    workflow-spec
    
4. Drop in the **ChatOps** workflow and one **implement-plan** workflow using the templates; keep required reviewers on.
    
    workflow-spec
    
5. Pin **toolchain versions** in CI (Node 22, etc.) and mirror locally (nvm/asdf + rustup).
